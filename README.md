### SecureLogin: Modern Authentication Interface with React 🔒

**Project Overview**  
Welcome to SecureLogin, your **modern authentication interface** built with React! This project provides a **sleek and secure way** for users to log in, emphasizing both functionality and user experience. 🛡️

**Features**  
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive form fields for username, phone number, password, confirm password, date of birth, and address.
- **Remember Me Option:** Includes a checkbox to remember user login details.
- **Advanced Alert System:** Utilizes React's `useState` hook to dynamically display login counts upon each successful login attempt.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensures seamless usage across different devices with CSS styling.

**How It Works**  
1. **Form Input:** Users enter their credentials into the form fields provided (username, phone number, password, etc.).
2. **Login Button:** Upon clicking the login button, the application triggers an alert displaying the incremented count of successful logins.
3. **State Management:** React's state management (`useState`) keeps track of the login count and updates it in real-time.

**Development Mode**  
To start the development server and run SecureLogin:

```bash
